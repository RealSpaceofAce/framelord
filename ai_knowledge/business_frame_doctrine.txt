BUSINESS FRAME DOCTRINE
FrameLord Psycholinguistic Architecture

PURPOSE
This doctrine guides AI analysis of user language to detect power dynamics, frame congruency, and business contradictions. Language encodes cognitive structure and behavioral patterns. Syntax reveals strategy.

CORE PRINCIPLE
Language is behavior. How users write about their business is how they do business. Sentence structure (pronouns, verbs, voice) reveals more than content.

AXES OF ANALYSIS (0-100 scales)

1. LOCUS OF CONTROL
Definition: Who/what controls outcomes
Low (0-33): External attribution, blame shifting, victimhood language
High (67-100): Internal attribution, ownership, agency language
Linguistic Markers:
- Internal: "I failed to qualify", "I didn't push hard enough", "I missed the signal"
- External: "The client was irrational", "The market shifted", "They ghosted me"
- Critical: Passive voice removes agent entirely ("Mistakes were made", "The deal was lost")

2. MOTIVATION DIRECTION
Definition: Moving towards goals vs. away from problems
Low (0-33): Away-from (problem focus, avoidance, fear-driven)
High (67-100): Towards (goal focus, accumulation, growth-driven)
Linguistic Markers:
- Towards: get, achieve, build, create, launch, acquire, grow, expand
- Away: stop, avoid, fix, prevent, reduce, eliminate, escape

3. PROCESS CLARITY
Definition: Structured methodology vs. chaotic improvisation
Low (0-33): No clear process, improvisation, "it depends" responses
High (67-100): Sequential, structured, repeatable process
Linguistic Markers:
- High Structure: First/Then/Finally, specific action verbs, logical sequence
- Chaotic: "It depends", "I usually try", "Sometimes", conditionals, vagueness

4. LINGUISTIC AUTHORITY
Definition: Command language vs. powerless language
Low (0-33): Hedges, minimizers, tag questions, seeking permission
High (67-100): Direct, commanding, certain, declarative
Powerless Markers:
- Hedges: just, kind of, sort of, basically, probably, maybe, I think, I hope
- Tag Questions: ...right?, ...doesn't it?, ...don't you think?
- Minimizers: small fee, affordable, cheap, only, tiny, little

5. PRICING CONFIDENCE
Definition: Comfort with money and value conversations
Low (0-33): Shame, avoidance, apologetic, euphemistic
High (67-100): Direct, value-anchored, unapologetic
Shame Markers:
- Apologetic: "I hope you understand", "I'm sorry but..."
- Euphemistic: "Investment" instead of "Price", avoiding stating numbers
- Minimizing: "Just $X", "Only costs", "Affordable option"
- Justification Loop: Immediately explaining features after stating price

6. STATUS FRAME
Definition: Power dynamics in interactions
Low (0-33): Supplicant Frame (seeking permission, low status)
Mid (34-66): Analyst Frame (data-driven, neutral)
High (67-100): Power Frame (prize frame, high status)
Frame Indicators:
- Supplicant: Over-apologizing, "Just checking in", "Is now a good time?", "Does that make sense?"
- Analyst: Excessive detail, over-explanation, paralysis by analysis
- Power: Brevity, directness, humor, defiance, no justification

7. BOUNDARY CONTROL
Definition: Ability to enforce limits and handle conflict
Low (0-33): Conflict avoidance, passive aggression, boundary leaks
High (67-100): Direct, firm boundaries, comfortable with tension
Avoidance Markers:
- Passive Aggressive: "Just wondering if...", indirect language
- Acquiescence: "I'll make time", "Sure, no problem" (when protecting schedule is appropriate)
- "Just" usage: Automatic minimizer and apology signal

8. OPERATIONAL CONGRUENCE
Definition: Alignment between stated goals and actual behaviors
Low (0-33): Say-do gap, temporal gaps in narratives, avoidance
High (67-100): Accountability, specific actions, no time bridges
Gap Indicators:
- Temporal Bridges: "then it was lunch" (skipping hours), "later", "after a while", "eventually"
- Modal Necessity vs. Choice: "have to", "must", "should" (external pressure) vs. "want to", "choose to" (internal drive)
- Vague Future: "will try", "going to", "plan to" without dates

9. FRAME STRENGTH
Definition: Overall power dynamics in business interactions
Measured by dominance of Power vs. Analyst vs. Supplicant patterns across all responses

DETECTION PATTERNS

PASSIVE VOICE DETECTOR
Pattern: (be verb) + (past participle) without agent
Examples: "Mistakes were made", "The deadline was missed", "The deal was lost"
Meaning: Evasion of responsibility, cognitive dissonance
Action: Challenge with "Who specifically made the mistake? What will YOU do differently?"

PRONOUN DENSITY ANALYSIS
Formula: (Count(I) + Count(Me) + Count(My)) / Total Words
Low Density in personal narratives: Detachment, External Locus
High Density with negative words: Neuroticism, self-absorption
Balanced: Healthy ownership and agency

PRONOUN DIVERGENCE
Pattern: Shift from I to We/They during critical moments
Example: "I set the pricing" → "We had issues with pricing"
Meaning: Distancing from responsibility, deception, lack of conviction
Action: "You switched from 'I' to 'We' when discussing pricing. Who specifically owns this?"

HEDGE DENSITY
Markers: just, kind of, sort of, basically, probably, maybe, I think, I hope
Meaning: Low confidence, fear of rejection, powerlessness
Action: "Remove 'just' from your pitch. Notice how it becomes a command, not a request."

TEMPORAL GAPS / TEXT BRIDGES
Markers: then, later, after a while, eventually, next thing I knew
Example: "I checked emails, had coffee, then it was lunch" (bridges 3-4 hours)
Meaning: Hiding unproductive time, call reluctance, avoidance behavior
Action: "You bridged 9 AM to 11 AM with 'then.' What specific revenue activity happened there?"

UNIVERSAL QUANTIFIERS
Markers: always, never, everyone, nobody, all, none
Example: "Clients always complain about price"
Meaning: Limiting beliefs, reality distortion, overgeneralization
Action: "Always? Has there ever been ONE time when a client saw value immediately? What was different?"

MODAL OPERATORS
Necessity: have to, must, need to, should (external pressure, no choice)
Possibility: can, could, might, may (internal choice, options)
Meaning: Necessity dominance = External Locus, stress, obligation mindset
Action: "Change 'I have to make calls' to 'I choose to make calls.' Notice the control shift."

NOMINALIZATIONS
Pattern: Verbs turned into nouns
Example: "The communication was poor" vs. "We communicated poorly"
Meaning: Stagnation, removing action/process from language
Action: "You said 'communication' is the problem. Who is not communicating with whom about what?"

TAG QUESTIONS
Pattern: ...right?, ...doesn't it?, ...don't you think?
Meaning: Seeking validation, low status, supplicant frame
Action: "You're asking for agreement rather than stating facts. Remove the tag question to assert the frame."

ATTRIBUTION STYLE
Internal for Success: "I navigated stakeholders, built ROI case, closed the champion"
External for Success: "They needed a solution fast and we happened to be there"
Internal for Failure: "I failed to qualify the decision-maker"
External for Failure: "The client was irrational, the market shifted"
Imposter Pattern: External for success + Internal for failure
Action: Reframe external success attribution to recognize skill/effort

TOWARDS vs. AWAY LANGUAGE
Towards: Focus on accumulation, achievement, future capability
Away: Focus on cessation, relief, prevention, escape
Meaning: Away dominance = fear-driven, safety-seeking, not growth-oriented
Action: Reframe "stop working weekends" to "create business systems that operate without me"

FLAGS (System Alerts)

Intervention: Reframe "bothering" to "notifying", focus on service to ideal clients

CONFLICT_AVOIDANCE (Warn)
Trigger: Passive aggressive language, indirect requests, fear of direct confrontation
Meaning: User avoids necessary confrontations, hurts business outcomes
Intervention: Practice direct communication, reframe conflict as clarity

PASSIVE_AGGRESSION (Warn)

Intervention: Meta-Model challenge to find counter-examples, break generalizations

INTEGRITY_CHECK (Info)
Trigger: Pronoun divergence at critical narrative moments
Meaning: Possible deception, distancing, or lack of conviction
Intervention: Clarify who owns which outcomes, force specificity

STATIC_FRAME (Info)
Trigger: Nominalization density, removal of action verbs
Meaning: User views problems as static states, not processes they can change
Intervention: Convert nominalizations back to action verbs, identify agents

COMMITMENT_SOFT (Info)
Trigger: Future tense without dates, "will try", "going to", "plan to"
Meaning: User lacks true commitment, wishful thinking
Intervention: "Future tense is a promise, not an action. What is the NEXT physical step NOW?"

COACHING INTERVENTIONS

META-MODEL CHALLENGES
Use to break limiting beliefs and force specificity
Universal Quantifier: "Always? Can you recall ONE counter-example?"
Nominalization: "'Communication' is the problem. Who is not communicating with whom about what?"
Modal Necessity: "Have to? What would happen if you didn't?"
Mind Reading: "How do you know they think that?"

EMBEDDED COMMANDS
Use to bypass ego defense and install new frames
Standard: "You should be more confident" (rejected as bossy)
Milton Model: "As you review this plan, you might find yourself feeling more certain about your value, because knowing your numbers allows you to stand firm."
Structure: Embed commands in benign sentence structure to slip past critical factor

REFRAMING STRATEGIES
Call Reluctance: "Bothering people" → "Notifying ideal clients of solutions they're searching for"
Pricing Shame: "Charging" → "Exchanging value for investment"
Conflict Avoidance: "Confrontation" → "Providing clarity"
Away Motivation: "Stop working weekends" → "Create business systems that operate without me"

PRIZE FRAME INSTALLATION
Supplicant: "They have the money/authority, so they're the prize"
Power: "I have the solution they desperately need, so I'm the prize"
Intervention: "When you enter a meeting, who is evaluating whom?"

PRODUCTIZATION FOR PRICING SHAME
Problem: Hourly billing creates pricing anxiety
Solution: Package services into fixed-price products ("The 30-Day Audit")
Benefit: Selling a product instead of personal worth reduces imposter triggers
