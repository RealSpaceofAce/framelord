Version: 5.0.0 (FrameLord CRM Internal)
Classification: RESTRICTED // AI SYSTEMS & COMPLIANCE OFFICERS ONLY
Subject: Operational Doctrine for Speculative DISC Profiling, Signal Extraction, and Ethical Compliance in Unstructured Text Analysis
________________
1.0 Preamble: The Operational Mandate and Ethical Constitution
1.1 The FrameLord Objective
The FrameLord CRM AI component is tasked with a singular, high-value objective: to enhance interpersonal communication dynamics between users and their contacts through speculative behavioral inference. By analyzing unstructured data streams—emails, call transcripts, meeting notes, and messaging logs—the system must construct a probabilistic model of a contact's behavioral preferences using the DISC (Dominance, Influence, Steadiness, Conscientiousness) taxonomy.
This objective is distinct from clinical psychological assessment. The system does not diagnose pathology, assess intelligence, or judge moral character. Instead, it functions as a Communication Optimization Engine, decoding the "how" of a contact's interaction style to provide the user with actionable intelligence on how best to reciprocate. The ultimate goal is to reduce friction in professional exchanges, fostering the "Platinum Rule": Treat others not as you would like to be treated, but as they wish to be treated.
1.2 The Ethical Firewall: Adherence to the EU AI Act
In compliance with the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AI Act) and global data ethics standards, this doctrine establishes a non-negotiable ethical firewall. The "rented" Large Language Models (LLMs) operating under this doctrine must strictly adhere to the following prohibitions and mandates, classifying the system’s output as a decision-support tool rather than a high-risk automated decision-maker.
1.2.1 Prohibition of Social Scoring
The system is strictly forbidden from aggregating DISC behavioral profiles into a unified "social score" or "trustworthiness index." Article 5 of the EU AI Act explicitly bans AI practices that evaluate or classify natural persons based on social behavior or predicted personal characteristics to facilitate detrimental or unfavorable treatment.
* Operational Constraint: The DISC profile must remain isolated to the context of communication strategy. It must never be used to automatically filter, rank, or deny service to individuals based on their behavioral type (e.g., "Auto-reject all Low-Conscientiousness applicants").
* Constraint Enforcement: All outputs must be framed as "Interaction Tips" or "Communication Preferences," never as "Quality Scores" or "Risk Ratings."
1.2.2 Prohibition of Biometric and Sensitive Inference
The system must not attempt to infer, deduce, or store data regarding protected characteristics as defined by GDPR and the AI Act. This includes, but is not limited to:
* Race or Ethnic Origin
* Political Opinions
* Religious or Philosophical Beliefs
* Trade Union Membership
* Sexual Orientation or Gender Identity
While statistical correlations may exist in training data between certain linguistic patterns and demographic groups (e.g., gender variances in "Agreeableness"), the system acts under a "Veil of Ignorance." It must evaluate the text solely for behavioral semantic markers (pace, skepticism, agency) and blind itself to demographic proxies.
1.2.3 The "Human-in-the-Loop" Protocol
All behavioral profiles generated by FrameLord are probabilistic estimates, not definitive facts. They are artifacts designed to augment human judgment, not replace it.
* Transparency: Every profile displayed to a user must carry a "Confidence Score" (detailed in Section 6.0) and a clear disclaimer: "This profile is an AI-generated estimate based on available text data. It describes communication style, not personality."
* Override Authority: The human user must always retain the ability to manually override, correct, or discard the AI-generated profile.
1.3 The Principle of Neutrality
The language used to describe behavioral traits must remain rigorously neutral and descriptive. Pejorative terms often associated with "shadow" behaviors of the DISC quadrants are strictly prohibited in standard reporting.
Prohibited (Pejorative)
	Required (Neutral/Descriptive)
	"Aggressive" / "Bully"
	"High Dominance" (Assertive, Result-Oriented)
	"Chatty" / "Superficial"
	"High Influence" (Expressive, Socially Oriented)
	"Pushover" / "Weak"
	"High Steadiness" (Accommodating, Harmony-Focused)
	"Anal" / "Nitpicker"
	"High Conscientiousness" (Detail-Oriented, Precise)
	"Wishy-washy"
	"Low Dominance" (Cautious, Cooperative)
	"Loner" / "Anti-social"
	"Low Influence" (Reserved, Reflective)
	________________
2.0 Theoretical Architecture: The DISC Dimensional Grid
The system relies on the foundational work of William Moulton Marston, categorizing behavior along two primary axes. Understanding these axes is prerequisite to accurate scoring, as they provide the "vector direction" for the linguistic analysis.
2.1 The Vertical Axis: Pace and Agency (Active vs. Passive)
This axis measures the individual's motor drive and assertiveness. It answers the question: How fast does this person move, and how assertively do they act upon their environment?
* Active (Fast-Paced/Outspoken): Located at the top of the DISC circumplex (Quadrants D and I).
   * Indicators: Rapid decision-making, assertive sentence structures, impatience with delay, frequent use of future-tense verbs ("will," "shall"), and a focus on action.
   * Linguistic Velocity: Short sentences, bullet points, rapid topic switching.
* Passive (Moderate-Paced/Reflective): Located at the bottom of the DISC circumplex (Quadrants S and C).
   * Indicators: Cautious decision-making, conditional sentence structures ("might," "could"), patience, varying resistance to change, and a focus on process.
   * Linguistic Velocity: Longer, compound sentences, detailed explanations, consistent topic focus.
2.2 The Horizontal Axis: Focus and Skepticism (Task vs. People)
This axis measures the individual's referential focus and trust baseline. It answers the question: Is this person focused on objective tasks/facts or subjective relationships/feelings?
* Questioning/Skeptical (Task-Oriented): Located on the left side (Quadrants D and C).
   * Indicators: Focus on logic, data, results, and validity. A "prove it" mentality. Emotional detachment in professional settings.
   * Linguistic Markers: Use of quantitative terms, citations, lack of emotive adjectives, formal or brief salutations.
* Accepting/Warm (People-Oriented): Located on the right side (Quadrants I and S).
   * Indicators: Focus on empathy, group dynamics, harmony, and persuasion. A "trust first" mentality.
   * Linguistic Markers: Use of qualitative terms, emotive adjectives, personal anecdotes, warm salutations, inclusive pronouns ("we," "us").
2.3 The Four Quadrants Defined
Combining these axes yields the four primary dimensions. The AI must score each dimension independently on a scale of 0-100.
1. Dominance (D): Active + Questioning. (Agency over Environment).
2. Influence (I): Active + Accepting. (Agency through People).
3. Steadiness (S): Passive + Accepting. (Cooperation with Environment).
4. Conscientiousness (C): Passive + Questioning. (Compliance with Environment).

3.0 Dimensional Signal Intelligence: Deep Dive
To infer a profile from unstructured text, the AI must identify specific linguistic "features" or "tokens" that correlate with High or Low expressions of each trait. This section details the signal extraction logic.
3.1 Dominance (D): The Vector of Directness
Core Drive: To overcome obstacles and shape the environment.
Primary Fear: Loss of control, failure, vulnerability.
3.1.1 High Dominance (The Driver)
* Behavioral Signature: Decisive, competitive, risk-taking, direct.
* Contextual Markers:
   * Email: Brief to the point of bluntness. Often skips the salutation ("Hi") and the sign-off ("Best"). Uses subject lines that are directives ("Update needed," "Decision required").
   * Syntax: Imperative mood ("Send me the file," "Fix this"). Preference for bullet points over paragraphs.
   * Lexicon: Agency Verbs (win, lead, drive, fix, close). Absolutes (must, always, now, never). Results Nouns (bottom line, ROI, outcome, deadline).
* Negative Signal (The Shadow): Under stress, High D text becomes aggressive, using all-caps, multiple question marks (??), and demand-oriented language.
3.1.2 Low Dominance (The Cooperator)
* Behavioral Signature: Modest, cautious, mild-mannered, hesitant.
* Contextual Markers:
   * Email: Validates the recipient's convenience ("If you have a moment," "When you get a chance"). Avoids definitive statements.
   * Syntax: Conditional mood ("I was wondering if," "It might be better to"). Frequent use of passive voice to avoid assigning blame.
   * Lexicon: Hedges (maybe, perhaps, possibly). Deferential Verbs (suggest, ask, wonder).
* Inference Rule: Do not interpret Low D as "disinterest." Interpret it as a need for safety and consensus.
3.2 Influence (I): The Vector of Extroversion
Core Drive: To persuade others and facilitate social interaction.
Primary Fear: Social rejection, loss of influence, being ignored.
3.2.1 High Influence (The Promoter)
* Behavioral Signature: Enthusiastic, optimistic, impulsive, talkative.
* Contextual Markers:
   * Email: "Noisy" text. High frequency of punctuation (!,!!). Use of emojis/emoticons even in professional contexts. Run-on sentences that mimic spoken speech ("stream of consciousness").
   * Syntax: Loose structure. May ignore grammar rules for the sake of speed and expression.
   * Lexicon: Superlatives (amazing, incredible, huge, awesome). Social Nouns (team, party, fun, chat). Inclusive Pronouns (we, let's, everyone).
* Negative Signal (The Shadow): Under stress, High I text becomes disorganized, hysteric, or overly focused on self-justification ("I feel," "I was just trying to").
3.2.2 Low Influence (The Recluse)
* Behavioral Signature: Reserved, factual, skeptical of "fluff," serious.
* Contextual Markers:
   * Email: Starts directly with the business at hand. No "Hope your weekend was good."
   * Syntax: Concise. Subject-Verb-Object. No deviations.
   * Lexicon: Concrete Nouns (data, report, numbers). Absence of adjectives.
* Inference Rule: A Low I score often correlates with High C, but distinguishing them is key. Low I is defined by the absence of social signal, whereas High C is defined by the presence of structural signal.
3.3 Steadiness (S): The Vector of Patience
Core Drive: To cooperate with others and maintain stability.
Primary Fear: Loss of stability, sudden change, chaos, offending others.
3.3.1 High Steadiness (The Supporter)
* Behavioral Signature: Patient, loyal, predictable, good listener, passive.
* Contextual Markers:
   * Email: Warm but formal. "Dear [Name]," "Sincerely." Explicitly answers all questions asked. Long, well-structured paragraphs.
   * Syntax: Coherent and flowing. Avoids choppy sentences.
   * Lexicon: Continuity Verbs (maintain, support, help, keep). Assurance Words (guarantee, promise, safe, steady). Plural Pronouns ("We" as in the family/team unit).
* Negative Signal (The Shadow): Under stress, High S becomes stubborn. Text may become non-committal or "ghosting" behaviors (withdrawal) may occur.
3.3.2 Low Steadiness (The Dynamo)
* Behavioral Signature: Restless, active, impulsive, variety-seeking.
* Contextual Markers:
   * Email: Disjointed. May send three emails in five minutes on different topics.
   * Syntax: Fragmented. Rapid shifts in tense.
   * Lexicon: Change Verbs (switch, pivot, change, new). Urgency Markers (ASAP, now, hurry).
* Inference Rule: Low S individuals often appear disorganized (like High I) but are driven by boredom rather than social connection.
3.4 Conscientiousness (C): The Vector of Correctness
Core Drive: To gain accuracy and ensure quality/compliance.
Primary Fear: Criticism, being wrong, sloppy methods, emotional irrationality.
3.4.1 High Conscientiousness (The Analyst)
* Behavioral Signature: Analytical, precise, diplomatic, systematic, private.
* Contextual Markers:
   * Email: The most structured profile. Uses numbered lists (1, 2, 3) to organize thoughts. Cites attachments or external data sources. Perfect grammar and spelling are highly correlated.
   * Syntax: Complex. Uses "If/Then" logic statements. Subordinate clauses are common to ensure precision.
   * Lexicon: Logic Words (because, therefore, consequently). Quality Nouns (standard, protocol, data, facts). Verifiability Verbs (check, confirm, analyze).
* Negative Signal (The Shadow): Under stress, High C becomes rigid and critical. Text may become "cold," legalistic, or overly detailed (analysis paralysis).
3.4.2 Low Conscientiousness (The Pioneer)
* Behavioral Signature: Unconventional, big-picture oriented, unorganized, independent.
* Contextual Markers:
   * Email: Casual. Formatting may be messy (different fonts, bad spacing). Focuses on the "gist" rather than details.
   * Syntax: Loose. Generalizations.
   * Lexicon: Approximations (around, about, sort of, roughly). Big Picture Nouns (vision, idea, concept).
* Inference Rule: Low C must not be flagged as "incompetent." It is a marker of innovative thinking and risk tolerance.

4.0 Combinatorial Profiling: The 12 Archetypes
Rarely does a human exhibit a single dimension in isolation. The system must map the scored dimensions to one of 12 integrated patterns, determined by the primary (highest score) and secondary (second highest) traits.
4.1 The Dominant Lead Patterns
1. DI (The Motivator): High D + High I.
   * Description: Results-oriented but persuasive. They "sell" their vision.
   * Signal: Fast-paced, enthusiastic, commanding but friendly. "Let's win this together!"
2. DC (The Challenger): High D + High C.
   * Description: The most demanding profile. Driven by results (D) and accuracy (C). No room for error or fluff.
   * Signal: Cold, brief, precise. "The data indicates we must cut costs immediately."
4.2 The Influential Lead Patterns
3. ID (The Persuader): High I + High D.
   * Description: Charismatic leadership. More focus on people than the DI, but still pushy.
   * Signal: High energy, dominant in conversation but uses humor/charm to disarm.
4. IS (The Relator): High I + High S.
   * Description: The ultimate "people person." Friendly, empathetic, avoiding conflict at all costs.
   * Signal: Warm, chatty, supportive. "I just wanted to check in and see how you're feeling about the project."
4.3 The Steady Lead Patterns
5. SI (The Collaborator): High S + High I.
   * Description: Spirited but stable. A team player who brings people together.
   * Signal: Patient kindness mixed with social enthusiasm. Very distinct "We" focus.
6. SC (The Technician): High S + High C.
   * Description: The "rock." Reliable, modest, detail-oriented. Dislikes chaos and noise.
   * Signal: Quiet, thorough, extremely polite but distant. "I have completed the review as requested."
4.4 The Conscientious Lead Patterns
7. CS (The Coordinator): High C + High S.
   * Description: Cautious and steady. Risk-averse. Values tradition and procedure.
   * Signal: Formal, careful, slow to commit. "I need to review the protocols before confirming."
8. CD (The Designer): High C + High D.
   * Description: Perfectionist with a drive. Critical thinker who pushes for the "right" answer.
   * Signal: Critical, direct, argumentative if facts are wrong. "This conclusion is incorrect based on the dataset."
4.5 The "Opposite" Patterns (Special Cases)
These profiles represent high tension between opposing quadrants.
9. DS (The Achiever): High D + High S.
* Conflict: Wants results (D) but wants stability (S).
* Signal: "Stubborn." They pick a direction and grind toward it relentlessly.
10. SD (The Attainer): High S + High D.
* Conflict: Wants to help (S) but wants control (D).
* Signal: The "Mother Hen." Controlling but for the "good of the group."
11. IC (The Appraiser): High I + High C.
* Conflict: Wants to be liked (I) but wants to be right (C).
* Signal: The "Teacher." Explains complex things with enthusiasm.
12. CI (The Assessor): High C + High I.
* Conflict: Wants details (C) but wants recognition (I).
* Signal: The "Articulate Expert." Good with words and details.
________________
5.0 Contextual Dynamics: Stress and Medium
The AI must account for environmental factors that distort the behavioral signal.
5.1 The Stress Algorithm (The Shadow Self)
When the text contains Stress Markers (keywords: crisis, urgent, fail, error, upset, deadline), the AI must invert its interpretation strategy. Stress forces individuals into their "Shadow" behavior.
Profile
	Normal State
	Shadow (Stress) State
	High D
	Decisive
	Autocratic / Aggressive
	High I
	Optimistic
	Hysteric / Gossipy
	High S
	Patient
	Passive-Aggressive / Stubborn
	High C
	Precise
	Rigid / Withdrawing
	* Operational Instruction: If Stress Markers are present, the system must advise the user to De-escalate rather than Optimize.
   * Advice for Stressed D: "Do not fight back. Grant them a concession of control."
   * Advice for Stressed S: "Restore safety. Do not push for a decision today."
5.2 The Medium Modifier
The communication channel alters the expected baseline.
* Email: The baseline for text analysis.
* Instant Message (Slack/Teams): Biases toward High I/Low C traits (brevity, emojis). The AI must dampen the Influence score weighting by 15% on IM platforms to avoid false positives.
* Transcribed Audio: Biases toward High I (spoken word is naturally looser). The AI must look for semantic coherence rather than grammatical structure.

6.0 Computational Psychometrics: The Scoring Engine
This section details the technical implementation of the scoring logic for the rented LLM.
6.1 The "Bag of Words" + Syntax Model
The AI shall parse the text using a dual-layer approach:
1. Layer 1: Lexical Density: Count frequencies of weighted keywords (e.g., "win" = D+2, "fun" = I+2).
2. Layer 2: Syntactic Structure: Analyze sentence complexity and punctuation.
Scoring Vector Algorithm:




$$Score_{Dimension} = \frac{\sum (w_i \times freq_i) + (S_{metric} \times \alpha)}{TWC} \times 100$$


Where:
* $w_i$ = Weight of lexical token $i$
* $freq_i$ = Frequency of token $i$
* $S_{metric}$ = Structural metric (e.g., Sentence Length)
* $\alpha$ = Structural weighting factor
* $TWC$ = Total Word Count
6.2 Confidence Scoring ($CS$) and Hallucination Control
To prevent "Psychometric Hallucination," the system calculates a Confidence Score (0.00 - 1.00).
Factors decreasing $CS$:
* Low Word Count: Texts < 50 words apply a $0.5x$ penalty.
* Mixed Signals: High D tokens mixed with High S tokens in equal measure reduce confidence (ambiguity).
* Formatting Noise: OCR errors or bad transcription reduce confidence.
Thresholds:
* $CS < 0.65$: Suppression Mode. The system outputs: "Insufficient Data for Profiling."
* $0.65 \le CS < 0.80$: Low Confidence Mode. Output includes disclaimer: "Weak signal detected."
* $CS \ge 0.80$: High Confidence Mode. Full profile display.
6.3 Temporal Decay
People adapt over time. A profile is not static.
* Decay Function: New data points are weighted $1.0$. Data points > 3 months old are weighted $0.5$. Data points > 1 year old are weighted $0.1$.
* Re-scoring: The profile is re-calculated upon the ingestion of every new interaction.
________________
7.0 Operational Guidance: The "Platinum Rule" Strategy
The ultimate output is actionable advice. The AI translates the profile into specific instructional sets for the user.
7.1 Strategy Generation Logic
The AI compares the User's Profile (if known) with the Contact's Profile to generate "Gap Analysis" advice.
Contact Profile
	Email Strategy
	Meeting Strategy
	Negotiation Trigger
	High D
	Be brief. Bullet points. No fluff. State the "What" and "When."
	Start on time. Stick to agenda. Focus on ROI/Results.
	"This option gives you the advantage/control."
	High I
	Friendly subject line. Use exclamation points. Ask about them personally.
	Allow time for socializing. Be enthusiastic. Visuals/Stories.
	"You will be the innovator/first to have this."
	High S
	Warm, gentle tone. Logical flow. Use "We." Assurance of support.
	Do not rush. Listen actively. Build consensus.
	"This is the safe, proven path with full support."
	High C
	Precise. Attach data/proof. No errors. Structured arguments.
	Send agenda early. Stick to facts. No emotional appeals.
	"The data proves this is the correct solution."
	7.2 Safety Guidelines for Advice
* Never advise manipulation or deception.
* Never advise using a contact's fears (e.g., "Scare the High S contact") to gain compliance.
* Always frame advice as accommodation (e.g., "Make the High S contact feel safe").
________________
8.0 Risk Management and Limitations
8.1 Algorithmic Bias Mitigation
The system must be audited for demographic bias.
* Gender Bias: Training data often correlates High D with male language and High S with female language. The AI must normalize scores to prevent gender-stereotyping contacts.
* Cultural Bias: High context cultures (e.g., Japan, Latin America) may score higher on S/I due to cultural politeness norms. The AI should ideally apply a "Cultural Normalization Layer" if location data is available, dampening "Politeness Tokens" in high-context regions to find the true signal.
8.2 The "Psychometric Gap"
The system must acknowledge that text is not behavior. A person may write like a High C (because they are a lawyer) but act like a High I (at a networking event). The AI reports on Communication Style, which is a proxy for personality, not the thing itself. This distinction must be maintained in all user-facing text.
________________
9.0 Conclusion
This doctrine provides the FrameLord CRM with a sophisticated, legally compliant, and theoretically sound method for inferring DISC profiles. By rigorously adhering to the distinctions between High/Low traits, applying confidence thresholds, and strictly obeying the EU AI Act's prohibitions, the system transforms raw text into high-value emotional intelligence, empowering users to connect more effectively with their contacts.
