FrameScan Doctrine: The Unified Protocol of Textual Persuasion
1. Overview of Persuasion Dynamics
The FrameScan 'Document Persuasion Analyzer' operates on the premise that persuasive communication is not merely an artistic endeavor but a quantifiable science of cognitive engineering. This doctrine serves as the foundational reference architecture for the system, codifying the disparate elements of textual influence into a unified protocol. The objective of high-performance copywriting is to align the semantic and structural properties of a message with the cognitive processing mechanisms of the receiver, thereby reducing friction and increasing the probability of a desired behavioral outcome.
Persuasion, in the context of this doctrine, is defined as the strategic deployment of linguistic and structural variables to modulate attention, emotional valence, and decision-making heuristics.1 It is a multi-dimensional process that navigates the tension between the "central route" of persuasion—characterized by logical, systematic processing of information—and the "peripheral route," which relies on rapid, heuristic shortcuts such as social proof, authority, and scarcity.2 Effective documentation does not choose between these routes but synchronizes them, creating a dual-channel assault on the reader's resistance.
The modern digital landscape has fundamentally altered the economics of attention. Information abundance has led to attention scarcity, necessitating the evolution of persuasion techniques that are more aggressive in their capture mechanisms and more sophisticated in their retention strategies.1 The FrameScan system must therefore analyze text not just for its semantic content, but for its "behavior-shaping structures"—the embedded syntax and narrative arcs designed to bypass critical filtering and trigger subconscious compliance.5
This analysis breaks down the persuasion ecosystem into constituent components: the attentional hooks that arrest the scanning eye; the structural frameworks that guide the logical progression of thought; the linguistic devices that enhance processing fluency; and the emotional triggers that provide the kinetic energy for action. By isolating these variables, we can construct a "Persuasion Density" metric, allowing for the objective assessment and optimization of any persuasive document.7
1.1 The Theoretical Basis of Influence
The core equation driving this doctrine posits that persuasion ($P$) is a function of Attention ($A$), Emotional Resonance ($E$), and Cognitive Clarity ($C$), mitigated by Friction ($F$).




$$P = \frac{(A \times E \times C)}{F}$$
Textual persuasion succeeds when it maximizes the numerator—grabbing attention, eliciting strong emotion, and presenting a clear argument—while minimizing the denominator, which represents the cognitive load and skepticism (friction) inherent in the reader.9 The techniques detailed in the subsequent sections are essentially tools to manipulate the variables within this equation. For instance, "Heuristic Shortcuts" reduce cognitive load (Friction), while "Pattern Interrupts" maximize Attention.3
Understanding the interplay between these variables requires a nuanced view of human psychology. We are not rational actors but rationalizing ones; decisions are often made on an emotional basis and justified post-hoc with logic.1 Consequently, the FrameScan protocol prioritizes the detection of "emotional logic"—structures that lead the reader to feel a conclusion is inevitable before they have logically verified it.
2. Cognitive Attention & Heuristic Triggers
In an environment of information saturation, the primary directive of any persuasive text is to arrest the "scanning" process. The human brain utilizes a filtering mechanism—the Reticular Activating System (RAS)—to ignore predictable stimuli and focus only on the novel, the dangerous, or the immediately beneficial. Persuasion cannot occur until this filter is penetrated.4
2.1 The Taxonomy of Attentional Hooks
The "hook" is the tip of the persuasive spear. Its singular function is to buy the reader's attention for the few seconds required to engage with the subsequent sentence. Hooks operate by creating a state of psychological disequilibrium—a gap between what the reader knows and what they realize they need to know.4
2.1.1 The Curiosity Gap Mechanism
The brain abhors a vacuum. When presented with incomplete information, the human mind generates a specific type of deprivation—a "cognitive itch"—that can only be scratched by obtaining the missing knowledge.13 This mechanism, often referred to as the Zeigarnik effect in broader psychology, is operationalized in copywriting through "blind" headlines and "fascinations."
A "blind" hook promises a specific benefit but withholds the mechanism of delivery. For example, a headline stating "The one linguistic trick that doubles conversion rates" is infinitely more compelling than "Use active verbs to improve conversion." The former creates a gap; the latter closes it immediately, rendering further reading unnecessary.14 FrameScan must identify these gaps by analyzing the ratio of promised utility to revealed mechanism. High-utility/low-revelation ratios indicate strong curiosity hooks.
2.1.2 The Pattern Interrupt & Contrarian Approach
To break the hypnotic rhythm of scrolling, effective copy often employs a "Pattern Interrupt." This technique involves presenting a stimulus that violates the reader's expectations or established schemas.11
* The Contrarian Hook: Stating a fact that contradicts "common wisdom" forces the brain to stop and re-evaluate. "Why 99% of diets fail (and why yours will too)" challenges the reader's optimism and existing knowledge base, demanding attention to resolve the conflict.13
* The Taboo/Confession: Admitting to a flaw or a secret ("I have to confess—I didn't think this would work") signals a departure from the polished, corporate "marketing speak" that users have learned to tune out. This "Confession Hook" leverages vulnerability to disarm the reader's cynicism, creating a sensation of intimacy and authenticity that is rare in commercial text.15
2.1.3 The Specificity & Direct Benefit Hook
While curiosity is powerful, it risks vagueness. The "Direct Benefit" hook counters this by appealing to the brain's greed and efficiency centers. It offers a tangible, quantifiable reward for the investment of attention. Specificity is the force multiplier here; "Lose 10 pounds in 30 days" is mechanically superior to "Lose weight fast" because the specific numbers signal a concrete plan rather than a vague hope.1

	2.2 Heuristic Processing Shortcuts
Once attention is secured, the text must maintain it by reducing the "caloric cost" of processing. The brain prefers "peripheral route" processing—making decisions based on cues and shortcuts (heuristics) rather than deep analysis.3 FrameScan analyzes the density of these heuristic triggers.
2.2.1 The Anchoring Heuristic
Human judgment is comparative, not absolute. We evaluate value based on the first piece of information (the anchor) we receive. In persuasive copy, this manifests in the "Price Anchoring" technique, where a high value is established early to make the eventual price appear trivial. However, anchoring extends beyond price; it applies to effort and time as well. By anchoring the reader to the "hard way" (e.g., "spending 10 years learning by trial and error"), the proposed solution (e.g., "a 4-week course") appears efficient and desirable.1
2.2.2 The Halo Effect & Authority Transfer
The "Halo Effect" is a cognitive bias where the perception of one positive trait influences the perception of other, unrelated traits. Copywriting leverages this by associating the product with high-status entities (influencers, prestigious institutions, or luxury concepts). If a trusted expert endorses a product, the reader's brain transfers the trust from the person to the product, bypassing the need for independent verification.3
2.2.3 The Bandwagon Effect (Consensus)
The evolutionary drive for safety in numbers makes the "Bandwagon Effect" a potent persuasion tool. The brain assumes that if a large number of people have taken an action, it is likely the correct/safe action.16 Phrases like "Join 60,000+ happy users" or "The #1 choice for professionals" trigger this heuristic. The FrameScan analyzer must detect these "Consensus Signals" and evaluate their specificity—exact numbers ($10,423$) are more persuasive than rounded ones ($10,000+$) as they imply a verifiable count rather than a marketing estimation.16
3. Structural Persuasion Frameworks
Persuasion is a linear process that moves the reader from a state of indifference to a state of committed action. This journey is not random; it follows specific structural frameworks that mirror the stages of human decision-making. These frameworks provide the skeleton of the document, ensuring that the emotional and logical arguments are presented in the optimal sequence.7
3.1 The Progressive Engagement Model (Genericized AIDA)
This framework is the standard for direct-response persuasion, guiding the reader through four distinct cognitive states.
1. Arrest (Attention): The disruption of the reader's current state. This is achieved through the hooks detailed in Section 2.
2. Engagement (Interest): The establishment of relevance. The text must demonstrate that it understands the reader's context, often by mirroring their worldview or articulating their internal monologue.7 This stage builds the "bridge" between the reader's reality and the writer's message.
3. Amplification (Desire): The modulation of emotional valence. Here, the text moves from intellectual interest to emotional want. It uses "future pacing" to help the reader visualize the benefits of the solution, creating a phantom memory of a future that hasn't happened yet.7
4. Directive (Action): The collapse of potential energy into kinetic action. The call to action (CTA) must be clear, imperative, and friction-free.7
3.2 The Agitation Protocol (Genericized PAS)
While the Progressive Engagement Model focuses on desire, the Agitation Protocol leverages the psychological principle of "Loss Aversion"—the fact that humans are motivated roughly twice as much by the fear of loss as by the prospect of gain.9
* Problem Identification: The text validates the reader's pain. "Struggling to convert leads?" This creates immediate resonance; the reader feels "seen."
* Agitation (The Twist): The text explores the implications of the problem. It takes a benign issue and reveals its malignancy. "If you don't fix this, your competitors will eat your market share, and you will be left behind." This increases the psychological cost of inaction.17
* Resolution (Solution): The product is introduced not as a luxury, but as the only logical relief to the acute pain created by the agitation phase. The relief is palpable, creating a positive emotional association with the offer.
3.3 The Transformational Arc (Genericized BAB)
This framework sells identity rather than utility. It frames the product as the catalyst for personal evolution.7
* The "Before" State: A gritty, realistic depiction of the user's current limitations and frustrations.
* The "After" State: A vivid, sensory-rich description of the user's life post-solution. This appeals to the "ideal self."
* The Bridge: The mechanism that spans the gap. By placing the product between the hell of the "Before" and the heaven of the "After," the product becomes the vehicle of salvation.
3.4 The Utility Translation Matrix (Genericized FAB)
In technical or B2B contexts, features must be translated into benefits to be persuasive. This framework ensures that no technical specification is left "orphaned" without a user-centric value.1
* Feature: The attribute (e.g., "Titanium casing").
* Advantage: The functional result (e.g., "Lighter and stronger than steel").
* Benefit: The emotional or practical payoff (e.g., "You can carry it all day without fatigue"). FrameScan checks for "orphan features"—specifications listed without a corresponding benefit translation.
4. Linguistic & Syntactic Manipulation
Persuasion occurs not just in what is said, but how it is said. The micro-structure of language—sentence length, phoneme choice, and grammatical patterns—exerts a subconscious influence on the reader's processing fluency and emotional state. FrameScan analyzes these linguistic markers to determine the sophistication of the persuasive attempt.5
4.1 Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) Markers
NLP in copywriting involves the use of specific language patterns to bypass conscious resistance and implant suggestions directly into the subconscious.6
* Presupposition: This technique involves structuring a sentence so that the premise must be accepted for the sentence to make sense. "When you experience the speed of our software..." presupposes that the user will experience it. It bypasses the "if" and moves directly to the "when".5
* Embedded Commands: These are directives concealed within a larger sentence structure. By subtly marking the command (through bolding, italics, or a shift in tone), the writer speaks to the subconscious. "I don't know if you're ready to buy this now, but..." allows the command "buy this now" to enter the mind without triggering a defense response.18
* Sensory Predicates: Using words that align with visual, auditory, or kinesthetic processing systems ("See the future," "Grasp the concept," "Hear the difference") increases "processing fluency," making the text feel more "true" and easier to absorb.18
4.2 Phonosemantics and Sound Symbolism
The phonetic quality of words carries intrinsic meaning. "Phonosemantics" is the study of how sound conveys emotion.
* Plosives (/b/, /p/, /t/, /d/, /k/, /g/): These sounds are percussive and abrupt. They convey power, precision, and finality. Headlines often utilize plosives to create impact ("Boost Profits Today").20
* Liquids and Nasals (/l/, /m/, /n/, /r/): These sounds are smooth and flowing. They are used to convey comfort, luxury, and ease. A spa advertisement would rely heavily on these phonemes.20
* The Keats Heuristic: Research suggests that statements that rhyme or have a strong rhythmic cadence are perceived as more truthful. "Alliteration" and "Assonance" are not just poetic devices; they are persuasion multipliers because they reduce the cognitive load of reading.5
4.3 Syntactic Rhythm and Modulation
The rhythm of the sentence controls the rhythm of the reader's heart.
* Parataxis: The use of short, simple sentences without conjunctions (e.g., "He came. He saw. He died."). This staccato rhythm creates a sense of urgency, speed, and factual authority. It is the language of action.21
* Hypotaxis: The use of complex sentences with subordination. This creates a sense of logical flow, sophistication, and nuance. It is the language of reasoning.
* The "Bucket Brigade": To maintain momentum through the text, copywriters use short bridging phrases (e.g., "Here's the deal," "But there's a catch," "Let me explain") to visually break up paragraphs and psychologically pull the reader into the next section.20
5. Emotional Resonance & Valence Shifting
Logic creates the justification for a decision, but emotion provides the impetus. A document that lacks emotional resonance is merely a report, not a persuasive instrument. FrameScan must map the "Emotional Profile" of the text, identifying which primary drives are being stimulated.1
5.1 The Core Emotional Drivers
Copywriting generally targets high-arousal emotions, as low-arousal emotions (like contentment) rarely lead to action.
* Fear (Self-Preservation): The most evolutionarily conserved driver. In copy, this manifests as FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) or the fear of falling behind. It is highly effective for generating immediate action.1
* Greed (Acquisition): The desire for accumulation—whether of wealth, time, or resources. "Get more for less" is the eternal promise of greed-based copy.
* Vanity (Status): The desire for social elevation. "Join the exclusive club" or "Be the envy of your neighbors" appeals to the ego's need for validation and hierarchy.12
* Altruism/Guilt: Used often in non-profit contexts, this appeals to the reader's self-concept as a "good person." It positions the donation or purchase as a moral duty.
5.2 Valence Shifting (The Emotional Rollercoaster)
Persuasion requires movement. A static emotional state leads to stagnation. Effective copy "shifts valence"—moving the reader from negative to positive states to generate kinetic energy.
* Negative to Positive: The text begins by inducing anxiety (Agitation) and then offers the product as the mechanism of relief. This contrast heightens the perceived value of the solution.9
* Doubt to Certainty: The text acknowledges the reader's skepticism ("You're probably thinking this is too good to be true") and then systematically dismantles it with proof, moving the reader to a state of confident belief.18
5.3 Vulnerability as a Trust Mechanism (The Pratfall Effect)
In a market saturated with hyperbole, perfection is suspicious. The "Pratfall Effect" suggests that a competent entity becomes more likable and trustworthy when they admit a minor flaw. "Confession Hooks" (e.g., "I used to be terrible at public speaking") leverage this. By admitting weakness, the writer proves their honesty; the reader then assumes that the subsequent positive claims are also true.15
6. Authority, Trust, & Social Validation Signals
Trust is the bridge between the promise and the purchase. In the absence of a personal relationship, the reader relies on "Trust Proxies"—signals that indicate the messenger is credible.12
6.1 The Consensus Heuristic (Social Proof)
The brain is wired to follow the herd. When uncertain, we look to the behavior of others to guide our own.
* Quantitative Proof: "Over 10,000 copies sold." Large numbers act as a safety signal. If thousands have bought it, it cannot be a scam.16
* Qualitative Proof: Specific testimonials are more powerful than generic praise. A review stating "This software saved me 10 hours a week" is a "Benefit-Rich Testimonial," whereas "Great product" is merely a sentiment signal. FrameScan evaluates testimonials for specific, falsifiable claims.22
* Implicit Social Proof: Using phrases like "Join the community" implies a pre-existing tribe that the reader is currently excluded from, triggering the desire for belonging.22
6.2 The Credibility Transfer (Authority)
Authority can be constructed or borrowed.
* Borrowed Authority: Associating the brand with established entities (e.g., "As seen on Forbes," "Partnered with Google"). This transfers the "Halo Effect" of the established brand to the new product.12
* Jargon as Signaling: In B2B or technical markets, the correct use of domain-specific terminology acts as a "Shibboleth"—a password proving that the writer is part of the in-group. It signals competence. However, this must be balanced; too much jargon alienates, while too little signals amateurism.24
* Specificity as Authority: Specificity signals truth. A claim of "We generated $187,432 in revenue" is infinitely more credible than "We generated a lot of revenue." Specific numbers imply that the data has been measured and verified.14
7. Urgency, Scarcity, & Temporal Pressure
Urgency and scarcity are the closers of the persuasion process. They function by exploiting "Reactance Theory"—the psychological principle that when a person's freedom of choice is threatened (e.g., by a deadline or stock limit), they react by desiring the threatened option more intensely.9
7.1 Quantitative vs. Temporal Scarcity
* Quantity-Based Scarcity: "Only 3 left in stock." This creates a competitive environment. The reader is not just fighting the clock; they are fighting other potential buyers. This taps into resource-guarding instincts.25
* Time-Based Scarcity: "Offer ends at midnight." This creates a "dead-line"—a temporal boundary that forces a binary decision (act now or lose forever). It combats procrastination, which is the natural enemy of conversion.25
7.2 The Status Scarcity Mechanism
Scarcity is not always about shortage; sometimes it is about exclusion. "Invite-only" or "Application required" frames the purchase not as a transaction, but as an ascension to a higher status tier. This leverages the "Velvet Rope" effect—the harder it is to get in, the more valuable the inside appears. This appeals directly to the Vanity driver.25
7.3 Authentic vs. Synthetic Urgency
Consumers are increasingly sophisticated and can detect "fake" urgency (e.g., a countdown timer that resets on refresh). Synthetic urgency destroys trust. Authentic urgency, supported by a reason (e.g., "We are closing enrollment to ensure we can support our current students"), increases conversion without sacrificing credibility. FrameScan must check for the "Reason Why" justification alongside any scarcity claim.26
8. Narrative Architecture & Storytelling Patterns
Facts are processed by the analytical brain (which is skeptical), while stories are processed by the experiential brain (which is receptive). Narrative persuasion works through "Transportation"—the reader is mentally transported into the story world, where they are less likely to generate counter-arguments.2
8.1 The Guide-Protagonist Dynamic
A common failure mode in persuasion is "Hero confusion"—where the brand positions itself as the hero of the story. In effective narrative frameworks (like the genericized StoryBrand), the customer is the Protagonist (Hero), and the brand is the Guide (Mentor).17
* The Hero: Has a problem and a goal.
* The Guide: Has empathy (understands the problem) and authority (knows the solution).
* The Plan: The Guide provides a clear path.
* The Call: The Guide challenges the Hero to take action.
* The Stakes: The Guide defines what will be lost if the Hero fails to act.
8.2 The "Us vs. Them" Binary
This pattern creates tribal cohesion by defining a common enemy. The "enemy" helps to clarify the brand's values and solidify the reader's loyalty.28
* The Enemy: Can be a competitor, a concept (e.g., "complexity," "fatigue"), or the Status Quo.
* The Polarization: "They want to keep you in the dark; We want to give you control." This binary logic forces the reader to choose a side, and by choosing the "Us" side, they commit to the brand.
8.3 The Open Loop (Narrative Tension)
Narratives are driven by the desire for closure. An "Open Loop" introduces a conflict or question at the beginning of the text that is not resolved until the end.29 This tension pulls the reader through the body copy. "I'm going to tell you the secret to doubling your traffic, but first, you need to understand why your current strategy is failing." The reader must read the middle section to get the reward (the secret).
9. Identity Signaling & Tribe Building
Modern consumption is highly conspicuous; we buy things to signal who we are. Effective persuasion does not just sell a utility; it reinforces a desired identity.30
9.1 Self-Consistency & Labeling
The "Consistency Principle" states that humans desire to act in accordance with their self-image.
* The Labeling Technique: By assigning a positive label to the reader ("For the serious investor," "For parents who truly care"), the copy compels them to act in a way that validates that label. To reject the offer is to reject the positive identity.9
* Identity Confirmation: The copy mirrors the reader's internal beliefs ("You know that quality is worth paying for"). This confirmation bias builds rapport and lowers resistance.
9.2 Tribal Language (Shibboleths)
Every tribe has a secret language. Using "Shibboleths"—words or phrases unique to a specific subculture—signals that the writer is an insider.31 In a fitness context, using terms like "macros" or "gains" signals tribal membership. FrameScan analyzes the text for these "Tribal Markers" to determine if the copy is effectively targeting a specific subculture or if it is generic and disconnected.
10. Framing, Anchoring, & Cognitive Bias Exploitation
The "Frame" is the mental window through which the reader views the offer. By changing the frame, the writer changes the perceived value without changing the actual product.
10.1 The Anchoring Effect (Price Psychology)
* Mechanism: Presenting a higher number before the price. "This course has a total value of $5,000." This sets the anchor. When the actual price of $497 is revealed, it is evaluated not against $0, but against the $5,000 anchor, appearing as a 90% discount rather than a $497 expense.1
10.2 Reframing (Contextual Shifts)
* Trivialization: "Less than the cost of a cup of coffee a day." This reframes a large monthly sum into a trivial daily expense, bypassing the brain's "pain of paying" center.5
* Loss Framing: "Stop losing money on ads" is often more persuasive than "Start making money on ads." This exploits Loss Aversion; the pain of losing $100 is psychologically more intense than the pleasure of gaining $100.9
10.3 The Choice Architecture (Nudge Theory)
* The Decoy Effect: Introducing a third, less attractive option to manipulate the choice between two others. For example, offering a "Print Only" subscription for $50 and a "Print + Digital" for $50 makes the "Digital Only" at $40 look like a bad deal and the "Print + Digital" look like exceptional value.33
* The Default Bias: Framing the desired action as the "Recommended" or "Most Popular" choice leverages the path of least resistance.
11. Visual Persuasion & Formatting Psychology
In the digital realm, reading is actually "scanning." The visual layout of the text is the first layer of persuasion. If the text looks visually dense ("Wall of Text"), the reader's brain predicts high cognitive load and may abandon the task before reading a single word.29
11.1 The Scannability Index
FrameScan evaluates the "Scannability" of the document.
* Subheads: These act as "signposts" for the scanning eye. A reader should be able to understand the entire argument just by reading the subheads.35
* Paragraph Depth: The optimal paragraph length for digital persuasion is 1-3 sentences. This creates "white space," which acts as "visual breathing room" for the brain.35
11.2 Bullet Points as Fascinations
Bullet points break the visual monotony and allow for rapid consumption of benefits. However, persuasive bullets are not just summaries; they are "fascinations".36
* Structure: Effective bullets often follow a generic "Feature + Benefit + Meaning" structure.
* The "Blind" Bullet: A bullet that teases a benefit but withholds the "how," creating curiosity (e.g., "The 3-second fix for back pain").
* Symmetry: Consistent length and starting verb types (e.g., all starting with dynamic verbs like "Boost," "Slash," "Gain") create a subconscious rhythm that pulls the eye down the list.37
11.3 Typographical Emphasis
The strategic use of bolding, italics, and CAPS directs the "internal voice" of the reader. It ensures that the most persuasive words (Power Words) are read even by the fastest skimmer. Bolding emphasizes importance; italics emphasize tone or stress. Overuse, however, creates "visual noise" that reduces authority.34
12. Opportunity Cost & Value Proposition Engineering
Value is not intrinsic; it is comparative. Persuasion requires manipulating the perceived value equation by highlighting the "Opportunity Cost" of inaction—what the user is giving up by not buying.38
12.1 The Cost of Inaction (COI)
Novice copywriters focus on the price of the product. Expert copywriters focus on the price of the problem.
* Implicit Cost: "How much is your time worth?" If a tool saves 10 hours a month, and the user values their time at $100/hour, the tool is "earning" them $1,000/month. This makes a $99 price tag irrelevant.39
* Explicit Cost: "You are wasting $500 a month on inefficient heating." This attaches a hard dollar figure to the status quo, making "doing nothing" an expensive choice.38
12.2 Value Stacking & Bonus Structuring
To maximize the "Return on Investment" (ROI) perception, the offer is often presented as a "stack" of components.
* Bonus Logic: Bonuses should not be random; they should address the specific objections or "next problems" created by the main product. If the product is a "Weight Loss Diet," a logical bonus is a "Meal Prep Guide" (addressing the objection of time) or a "Dining Out Cheat Sheet" (addressing the objection of social life). This increases the Perceived Value without lowering the price.40
13. Vulnerability & Confession Mechanisms
In an era of deepfakes and AI-generated content, human vulnerability is a premium asset. "Radical Transparency" or "Anti-Marketing" utilizes the admission of flaws to build unshakeable trust.23
13.1 The Confession Hook
Starting a narrative with "I was wrong," "I failed," or "I was scared" instantly disarms the "sales resistance" radar. The reader's heuristic assumption is: "Liars try to look perfect; this person is admitting a flaw; therefore, they must be telling the truth." Once this truth-baseline is established, the reader is more likely to accept the subsequent sales claims as true.15
13.2 Addressing Skepticism (The "Elephant in the Room")
If an offer sounds too good to be true, the reader knows it. If the copywriter ignores this doubt, they lose trust. If they voice the doubt ("You're probably thinking this is impossible..."), they gain credibility. By explicitly stating who the product is not for ("This is not for lazy people"), the writer disqualifies the wrong audience while intensifying the attraction for the right audience.12

* Persuasion Density: This metric prevents "fluff." It is calculated by identifying the density of persuasive devices (Power Words, NLP patterns, Hooks) relative to the total word count. A density score that is too high (>15%) may trigger "Sales Pressure" resistance; a score too low (<5%) indicates "Informational Drift."
* Agitation Index: This analyzes the first 35% of the document for pain-associated keywords. A low score here typically correlates with a failure to establish resonance (The "So What?" problem).
* Urgency Authenticity Check: The system cross-references Urgency claims (e.g., "Only 3 left") with Justification text. If Urgency is High but Justification is Null, the system flags a "Trust Risk" for synthetic scarcity.
* You/We Ratio: A critical linguistic metric. If the count of first-person plural pronouns ("We," "Our," "Us") exceeds the count of second-person pronouns ("You," "Your"), the document is flagged as "Brand-Centric" rather than "Customer-Centric," a primary cause of conversion failure.
This schema and doctrine provide a complete, scientifically grounded system for the deconstruction and reconstruction of persuasive text, ensuring that FrameScan delivers actionable, high-level analysis aligned with the cognitive realities of human decision-making.
