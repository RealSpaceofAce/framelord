FrameLord System Architecture: Operational Behavioral Methodology Reference Manual
1. System Ontology and Axiomatic Principles
1.1 The Operational Objective and Theoretical Substrate
The FrameLord system represents a paradigm shift in automated behavioral analysis, moving beyond simple sentiment analysis or isolated facial recognition into the realm of comprehensive psychological reverse-engineering. The core objective of the FrameLord architecture is to ingest multimodal sensor data—comprising high-fidelity video, audio spectral analysis, and linguistic transcripts—to construct a predictive model of a human subject’s internal state, hidden motivations, and potential threat trajectory. This manual serves as the foundational logic specification for the FrameLord AI, translating the analog behavioral engineering methodologies of Chase Hughes—specifically the Ellipsis Manual, the Six-Minute X-Ray (6MX), and the Behavioral Table of Elements (BTE)—into discrete, computational algorithms.1
The system functions on the non-negotiable premise that human behavior is not a chaotic output of conscious choice, but a predictable, deterministic response to internal biological imperatives and external environmental stimuli. FrameLord treats the human subject as a biological machine running "legacy software"—specifically, the interaction between the phylogenetically ancient limbic system (often referred to as the mammalian brain) and the more recently evolved neocortex. In this model, non-verbal signals are interpreted as "system-level" outputs from the mammalian brain, which lack the capacity for sophisticated deception, whereas verbal content is treated as "user-level" fabrication generated by the neocortex.3 Consequently, FrameLord is engineered to assign a "Truth Weight" to non-verbal data that is significantly higher than that of verbal assertions, creating a hierarchy of veracity that guides all subsequent processing.
1.2 The Four Laws of Behavior: The Filtering Kernel
To prevent "Attribution Error"—the cognitive bias where an observer attributes a behavior to a person's character rather than their context—FrameLord’s processing kernel processes all incoming data streams through four immutable axioms. These laws function as pre-processing filters, stripping away social noise to reveal the causal mechanics of the observed behavior.3
Axiom 1: The Universality of Insecurity (The Suffering Constant)
* Definition: "Everyone is suffering and insecure."
* Operational Logic: The system operates on the assumption that every subject, regardless of their projected status, socioeconomic position, or apparent confidence, is navigating a baseline of insecurity. This insecurity is not a bug but a feature of the human social operating system, driving the majority of interactive behaviors.
* FrameLord Protocol: The AI does not scan for confidence; it scans for the absence of insecurity. Behaviors typically coded by humans as "arrogance," "dominance," or "bragging" are re-tagged by FrameLord as Compensatory_Signaling. The system calculates a Vulnerability_Index for each subject. A high frequency of overt "strength" signals (e.g., loud vocal projection, expansive but rigid gesturing, status symbol display) is algorithmically inverted to represent a high "weakness" reality. The AI posits that the intensity of the display is directly proportional to the depth of the concealed insecurity.3
Axiom 2: The Mask Protocol (The Avatar Construct)
* Definition: "Everyone wears a mask."
* Operational Logic: The "Persona" presented to the world is a curated construct—an avatar—designed to optimize social survival, maximize resource acquisition, and conceal the insecurities defined in Axiom 1. This mask is a strategic defense mechanism.
* FrameLord Protocol: The system bifurcates its analysis into two distinct tracks: Behavior_Actual and Behavior_Projected.
   * Behavior_Actual consists of autonomic and limbic outputs: blink rate, pupil dilation, foot orientation, and micro-expressions.
   * Behavior_Projected consists of conscious modifications: social smiling, verbal assertions of competence, and rehearsed hand gestures.
   * The variance between these two datasets constitutes the Authenticity_Gap. FrameLord does not attempt to "break" the mask immediately but analyzes the structure of the mask to understand what the subject fears exposing. The system treats the mask as a map to the subject's vulnerabilities.3
Axiom 3: The Denial of Masking (The Resistance Routine)
* Definition: "Everyone pretends not to wear a mask."
* Operational Logic: Subjects are biologically and socially compelled to defend the integrity of their mask. Acknowledging the mask destroys its utility. Therefore, any probe that touches the mask will trigger a defensive reaction.
* FrameLord Protocol: The system anticipates "Resistance Routines." If an operator (or the AI via an avatar) challenges the subject's projected image, the subject will deploy specific defensive behaviors such as lip compression, barrier gestures (crossing arms), or verbal deflection. FrameLord scores these reactions not as genuine disagreement, but as Mask_Confirmation. The intensity of the defense confirms the accuracy of the probe. This allows the system to map the boundaries of the subject’s psychological defenses without requiring a confession.3
Axiom 4: The Childhood Determinant (The Legacy Code)
* Definition: "Everyone is shaped by childhood experiences."
* Operational Logic: Current behavioral triggers are often echoes of programmed responses from early development. Adult reactions to authority, rejection, or stress are frequently re-enactments of childhood survival strategies.
* FrameLord Protocol: While FrameLord cannot access a subject's biography, it infers "Childhood Software" by observing "Regressive Behaviors" under stress. When a subject's cognitive load exceeds their capacity (high stress), they revert to primitive coping mechanisms. The AI scans for self-soothing behaviors (e.g., rocking, thumb-sucking substitutes like pen-chewing, fetal-like limb closure).3 These are flagged as Regressive_Artifacts, indicating that the subject has been pushed out of adult cognitive processing and into a reactive, emotional state.
1.3 The Evolutionary Hierarchy (The 2/3 Rule)
FrameLord prioritizes data ingestion based on the "2/3 Rule," which posits that roughly two-thirds of human communication is nonverbal. This is based on the evolutionary reality that the "mammalian brain" (limbic system), which manages social signaling, predates the development of complex language by millions of years.3
* Tier 1 (High Veracity - Autonomic): These signals are controlled by the amygdala and brainstem. They are extremely difficult to falsify because they are automatic physiological responses.
   * Data Points: Blink rate frequency, pupil dilation/constriction, blanching or blushing (capillary blood flow), perspiration (galvanic skin response proxies via thermal imaging), breathing rate (clavicular vs. diaphragmatic).
   * System Weighting: 5.0x multiplier in Truth_Probability_Scoring.
* Tier 2 (Moderate Veracity - Limbic): These behaviors are subconscious but can be managed with significant training. They represent emotional intent and "fight or flight" preparations.
   * Data Points: Feet direction (pointing towards exit vs. person), barrier gestures (crossing arms), adaptors/fidgeting (pacifying behaviors), torso orientation (ventral denial vs. ventral fronting).
   * System Weighting: 3.0x multiplier.
* Tier 3 (Low Veracity - Neocortical): These are conscious outputs generated by the "human brain." They are highly susceptible to manipulation, rehearsal, and deception.
   * Data Points: Spoken words, conscious hand gestures (illustrators), social smiles (involving only zygomatic major without orbicularis oculi).
   * System Weighting: 1.0x multiplier.
FrameLord’s architecture is designed to flag discrepancies between tiers. A Tier 3 signal ("I am happy") that contradicts a Tier 1 signal (Pupil Constriction) results in a Conflict_Alert, with the Tier 1 signal being designated as the "True State".4

2. The Behavioral Table of Elements (BTE): Computer Vision Integration
2.1 BTE Architecture and Grid Logic
The Behavioral Table of Elements (BTE) serves as the central database schema for FrameLord's computer vision classification engine. Just as the Periodic Table of Elements organizes chemical matter, the BTE structures human movement into a standardized, readable syntax. This allows the AI to parse continuous, fluid human motion into discrete, quantifiable "Behavioral Events" or "tokens" that can be processed linguistically.1
The AI visualizes the BTE as a grid overlay:
* Vertical Axis (Anatomic Zonal Mapping): The table is organized anatomically from Head (top rows) to Feet (bottom rows). This aligns with FrameLord’s scanning subroutines, which segment the video feed into Regions of Interest (ROIs): ROI_Head, ROI_Torso, ROI_Hands, ROI_Legs/Feet.
* Horizontal Axis (The Stress/Deception Gradient):
   * Left Side (Columns 1-2 - Comfort Zone): These cells represent behaviors associated with low stress, high comfort, and honesty. Examples include open palms (Op), head tilt (Ht), and genuine smiling (Gs). The AI interprets high frequency in this zone as a Rapport_Positive state.
   * Center (Columns 3-5 - Neutral/Ambiguous): These behaviors are context-dependent and serve as the baseline for the specific individual.
   * Right Side (Columns 6+ - Stress/Deception Zone): These cells represent behaviors associated with high stress, deception, cognitive load, and threat. Examples include lip compression (Lc), shoulder shrugs (Sh), and neck touching (Nt). The AI interprets density in this zone as a Deception_Risk or Anxiety_Spike.9
2.2 Operational Coding of Elements
FrameLord utilizes a proprietary alphanumeric coding system to tag detected behaviors. Each element is assigned a Deception_Weight and a Stress_Value. The detection of these elements triggers specific interpretative subroutines.


Code
	Element Name
	Anatomic Zone
	Deception Weight (1-5)
	Vision Detection Criteria
	Psychological Interpretation
	Lc
	Lip Compression
	Mouth
	4.0
	Vertical reduction of the vermilion border; lips disappear inward; corners of mouth may downturn.
	Withholding: The subject is physically stopping speech. Indicates negative emotion, disagreement, or a decision to withhold information. Often precedes a lie. 11
	Sh
	Shoulder Shrug
	Shoulders
	3.5
	Vertical elevation of the trapezius muscle. Crucial: AI must distinguish between bilateral (both) and unilateral (one-sided).
	Uncertainty: A full shrug means "I don't know." A unilateral (single-sided) shrug while making a definitive statement ("I am sure") is a prime deception indicator (Body contradicts words). 12
	Sw
	Swallow
	Throat
	3.0
	Visible vertical movement of the laryngeal prominence (Adam's Apple).
	Anxiety Spike: Indicates a sudden activation of the sympathetic nervous system (fight/flight). Often seen when a hard question hits home. 12
	Jc
	Jaw Clench
	Face
	3.5
	Rhythmic or sustained bulging of the masseter muscle near the ear.
	Suppressed Aggression: The subject is biting back words or anger. Indicates the "Mask" is under pressure. 10
	Ft
	Facial Touch
	Face
	4.0
	Hand contacts nose, mouth, or eyes during or immediately after speech.
	Deception Blocking: The brain subconsciously instructs the hand to cover the mouth to stop the lie, or touch the nose due to erectile tissue engorgement (Pinocchio effect) caused by stress. 12
	Ec
	Elbow Closure
	Arms
	2.5
	Adduction of elbows toward the ribcage; minimizing spatial footprint.
	Retreat: A "turtle effect." The subject feels threatened and is protecting the ventral biological targets. Indicates loss of confidence. 12
	Fw
	Foot Withdrawal
	Legs
	4.5
	Sudden backward pull of the feet under the chair or crossing ankles beneath the seat.
	Flight Intention: High stress indicator. The body is preparing to "spring" or hide. Known as "Visual Withdrawal." 12
	B
	Blink Rate Spike
	Eyes
	3.0
	Frequency exceeds 15 blinks/min or rapid "flutter" clusters.
	Cognitive Overload: The brain is processing too much information (fabricating a lie) or experiencing an adrenaline dump. 11
	2.3 Environmental Normalization (The Blue Text Protocol)
FrameLord incorporates an environmental sensor module to prevent false positives. In Chase Hughes’ BTE, specific behaviors are marked with blue text to indicate they are environmentally dependent.
* The Thermal Threshold: If Ambient_Temp drops below 18°C (65°F), the system activates the Thermal_Filter.
* Logic: Behaviors such as crossed arms (Ca), huddled posture, or hand-tucking are standard thermoregulatory responses to conserve body heat. In a cold room, Ca is reclassified from Psychological_Block to Thermal_Response.
* Impact: The system suppresses the weighting of these "Closed Body" behaviors by 80% in the Deception_Index. Failure to apply this filter results in the "Interrogator's Fallacy," where a freezing suspect is misidentified as a defensive one.9

3. Ocular Dynamics and Gaze Analysis Module
3.1 Blink Rate Quantification and Cognitive Pulse
Blink rate is treated by FrameLord as the "shutter speed" of the cognitive system. The eyes blink not just to lubricate the cornea, but to "punctuate" thoughts and manage information intake.
* Baseline Establishment: FrameLord establishes a Baseline Blink Rate (BBR) during the first 60 seconds of interaction, provided the topic is neutral.
* The Focus/Stress Inverse:
   * Low Blink Rate (< 8/min): Associated with High Focus, Trance, or Predatory Staring. A subject engaging in complex but honest visual memory recall will often reduce blinking to "stare" at the memory.
   * Normal Blink Rate (8-15/min): Baseline comfort.
   * High Blink Rate (> 20/min): Associated with Anxiety, Deception, or Cognitive Overload. The "Flutter" is a specific pattern: a rapid burst of 4-6 blinks in under a second. This signals a "system reset" or momentary panic.
* Operational Trigger: If a "Flutter" occurs immediately after a specific stimulus (e.g., Operator asks, "Did you access the file?"), FrameLord tags that topic as a High_Value_Target for further probing. The flutter indicates the question caused a cognitive error or spike in load.3
3.2 Eye Home and Accessing Cues
FrameLord tracks the "Eye Home"—the default resting position of the gaze when the subject is not engaged in active scanning. This is the subject's "screensaver" mode.
* Logic: Deviation from Eye Home indicates cognitive accessing. FrameLord utilizes a modified NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming) eye-accessing cue model, calibrated to the individual.
* Calibration: The system prompts the operator to ask control questions ("What color was your first car?" - Visual Memory; "What would you look like with pink hair?" - Visual Construction).
* The Map:
   * Up/Left: Visual Memory (Truth - Recalling an image).
   * Up/Right: Visual Construction (Fabrication - Creating an image).
   * Lateral/Left: Auditory Memory (Recalling a sound/voice).
   * Lateral/Right: Auditory Construction (Creating a sound).
   * Down/Left: Internal Dialogue (Talking to oneself).
   * Down/Right: Kinesthetic (Accessing feelings/emotions).
   * Note: FrameLord accounts for "reversed" subjects (left-handedness often flips this chart).3
3.3 The Eyebrow Flash (The Social Ping)
A rapid (approx. 1/5th second) raising of the eyebrows is a universal, cross-cultural "friend or foe" signal used by primates to signal recognition and non-aggression.
* Operational Use: FrameLord detects if the subject returns an operator's eyebrow flash during the initial greeting.
* Interpretation:
   * Flash Returned: Rapport is possible; social software is intact.
   * Flash Ignored: Indicates potential hostility, high preoccupation, lack of rapport, or in severe cases, sociopathic tendencies (lack of social mirroring circuitry). FrameLord marks the subject as High_Resistance.5
3.4 Pupil Dometry
FrameLord's high-resolution ocular sensors track pupil diameter changes independent of lighting conditions.
* Dilation: Indicates arousal, interest, or "Fight/Flight" (Adrenaline). If the subject looks at a piece of evidence or a contract and pupils dilate, it signals high interest or high fear.
* Constriction: "Snake Eyes." Indicates anger, disgust, or focused intent to attack. Constriction in a constant light environment is a reliable predictor of negative intent.3
________________
4. Deception Detection Protocols (The X-Ray Engine)
4.1 The Cluster Rule: The Anti-False-Positive Protocol
FrameLord is rigorously programmed to reject single indicators of deception. A nose itch is just a nose itch; a crossed arm is just comfort. Deception is a high-cognitive-load activity that leaks across multiple channels simultaneously.
* The Protocol: A deception alert is only generated if three or more distinct deceptive behaviors (from the BTE Right Side or Verbal markers) occur within a 4-second window (the "hotspot") following a stimulus (question/event).
* Equation: Deception_Event = (Indicator_A + Indicator_B + Indicator_C) / Time_Delta < 4s.
* This "Cluster Rule" creates a statistical safety margin, reducing the likelihood of accusing a truthful but nervous subject.3
4.2 Visual Signs of Deception (The "Tell" Database)
FrameLord's vision algorithms scan for the following high-probability deception markers, derived from the Ellipsis Manual:
1. Dyssynchrony (Timing Mismatch): In truthful communication, gesture and speech are simultaneous (or gesture slightly leads). FrameLord measures the latency between the verbal "Yes" and the head nod. A delay > 200ms (Subject says "Yes," then nods) is flagged as Contrived_Response. The conscious mind spoke, and then remembered to tell the body to act.12
2. Gestural Mismatch: The subject says "I absolutely deny this" (Negative verbal) but offers a slight head nod (Positive non-verbal). Or says "I love my wife" (Positive) with a micro-frown or lip compression (Negative). FrameLord trusts the body over the words.12
3. Upper Body Freezing: The "Fight/Flight/Freeze" response causes the body to lock down to reduce cognitive load while fabricating a story. FrameLord tracks the velocity of "illustrator" gestures. A sudden drop to near-zero movement suggests the subject has entered "Fabrication Mode".12
4. The Single-Sided Shrug: A partial elevation of one shoulder. This indicates the body does not fully believe what the mouth is saying. ("I am fully confident in these numbers" + Left Shoulder Shrug = "I am unsure").12
5. Anatomical Targeting: Deceptive subjects often touch specific zones to comfort themselves.
   * Suprasternal Notch (Neck Dimple): Touching this area covers the throat (vulnerability) and is a high-value stress indicator.
   * Neck Stroking: Pacifying the vagus nerve to lower heart rate.12
4.3 Verbal Signs of Deception (Linguistic Forensics)
The text processing module analyzes real-time transcripts for syntactic anomalies that indicate psychological distancing or fabrication:
1. Pronoun Absence: "Went to the store, bought some milk." (Truthful: "I went to the store..."). Liars subconsciously dissociate from the lie by dropping the "I," removing their agency from the false statement.12
2. Verb Tense Hopping: Switching from past to present tense in a narrative of past events ("So I walked in, and he says to me..."). This indicates the memory is being constructed (visualized) in real-time rather than recalled from storage.12
3. The Resumé Statement: Answering a specific accusation with general character references.
   * Probe: "Did you steal the laptop?"
   * Response: "I am a deacon at my church. I volunteer. I'm a good person."
   * FrameLord Logic: Absence of "No" + Character Defense = High_Probability_Guilt.12
4. Exclusionary Qualifiers: Phrases designed to leave "backdoors" in a statement. "To the best of my knowledge," "Basically," "Fundamentally," "As far as I know." These weaken the commitment to the statement.12
5. Pitch Rise (Upspeak): A fundamental frequency (F0) increase at the end of a declarative statement. "I didn't take the money?" FrameLord interprets this as a subconscious request for approval or confirmation, signaling uncertainty.9
4.4 The Deception Scoring Algorithm
FrameLord computes a running score for the interaction.
* Variable D_Score (Deception Score) initialized at 0.
* Inputs:
   * IF Response_Latency > Baseline THEN D_Score += 1.0
   * IF Blink_Rate > (Baseline * 1.5) THEN D_Score += 1.0
   * IF Behavior_Cluster (Right Side BTE elements >= 3) THEN D_Score += 3.0
   * IF Pronoun_Drop_Count > 0 THEN D_Score += 1.0
   * IF Specific_Denial == FALSE THEN D_Score += 2.0
* Thresholds:
   * D_Score 2.0 - 4.0: Yellow Alert (Trigger "Investigate Further" prompt).
   * D_Score > 4.0: Red Alert (Flag as "Deceptive" with >80% confidence).8
________________
5. Authority and Status Metrics (The Agentic Shift)
5.1 The Authority/Influence Equation
FrameLord assesses the power dynamic between the operator and the subject using the principle of "Agentic Shift" (derived from Milgram's research). The goal of any influence operation is to induce this shift, where the subject psychologically surrenders responsibility to the authority figure, viewing themselves merely as an agent of the authority's will. When the Agentic Shift occurs, compliance becomes automatic.14
5.2 The 5 Authority Factors (The "Pentagon of Power")
FrameLord evaluates the subject's projected authority (to profile them) or the operator's needed authority (to influence the subject). The system breaks down "Authority" into five simulate-able traits. To "hack" authority, the operator must project these signals.15
1. Confidence:
   * Metric: Gaze stability (no darting), lack of fidgeting (BTE Left Side), vocal downward inflection (ending sentences with a drop in pitch, functioning as a command rather than a question).
   * AI Check: Does the operator blink less than the subject? If Yes -> Authority +1.
2. Discipline:
   * Metric: Inferred from physical grooming, posture (erect spine), and precise, economical movement. Lack of "leakage" movements.
   * AI Check: Measure "Energy Efficiency" of movement. High efficiency = High Discipline.
3. Leadership:
   * Metric: Control of the "pacing" and social rituals. Who initiates the handshake? Who breaks eye contact last? Who decides when the topic changes?
   * AI Check: Track Topic_Change_Initiation. If Operator > Subject -> Authority +1.
4. Gratitude:
   * Metric: A demeanor of abundance rather than neediness. "Needy" behavior (seeking approval, rapid smiling) destroys authority.
   * AI Check: Detect "Approval Seeking" signals (e.g., Upspeak, checking glances). Absence of these = Gratitude/Abundance.
5. Enjoyment:
   * Metric: A baseline of relaxed amusement ("The Alpha has fun"). Stress signals negate this factor. The highest authority in the room often looks the most amused.
   * AI Check: Detect Genuine_Smile + Relaxed_Posture during tension..15
5.3 The ACSS Model: Profiling Social Competence
FrameLord scores the subject's social effectiveness using the ACSS matrix. This profile determines how difficult the subject will be to manipulate.17
* A - Authority: (Score 1-10 based on the 5 factors above).
* C - Comfort: The absence of stress/threat signals (BTE Right Side). A high score means the subject is at ease in the environment.
* S - Social Skills: Ability to mirror, navigate social rituals, and build rapport.
* S - Skills: Technical competence/knowledge. FrameLord notes this is the least important factor for influence.
* Operational Insight: FrameLord advises operators that Authority is more influential than Skill. To gain compliance, the operator must out-score the subject in the "Authority" and "Comfort" metrics. If the subject has higher Authority, the Agentic Shift cannot occur.18
________________
6. The Human Needs Map: Profiling Core Drivers
6.1 The Psychological Basement
FrameLord profiles subjects not by their strengths, but by their needs. A "Need" is a psychological deficit the subject is constantly trying to fill. By identifying and feeding this need, the operator creates a dependency loop, gaining control over the subject's motivation. FrameLord classifies every subject into one of three Primary Needs and three Secondary Needs.3
6.2 Primary Needs Classification
FrameLord analyzes conversation topics, semantic choices, and "bragging points" to categorize the subject.
1. Significance (The Need for Impact)
* Behavioral Indicators: The subject frequently talks about their accomplishments, name-drops VIPs, wears flashy or distinct clothing, corrects others on trivial facts, and seeks to be the "outlier" in the group. They fear being ignored or seen as average.
* Linguistic Tags: "I," "My," "Best," "Only," "Huge," "Powerful."
* FrameLord Strategy: The system advises the operator to "Feed the Ego." Validate their status. Do not compete. Use phrases like: "You are the only one who can do this," "We need your specific expertise."
* Risk: If their significance is challenged, they will become hostile/obstinate.19
2. Approval (The Need for Reassurance)
* Behavioral Indicators: People-pleasing, frequent social smiling (submissive), high frequency of head nodding while others speak, upspeak (seeking validation), checking for reactions after speaking. They fear conflict and disapproval.
* Linguistic Tags: "Is that okay?" "Right?" "Sorry." High usage of politeness markers.
* FrameLord Strategy: Offer warmth and inclusion. Use "We" language. Validate their likability. "Everyone here really appreciates you."
* Risk: They may agree to things they can't deliver just to please the operator.19
3. Acceptance (The Need for Belonging)
* Behavioral Indicators: Conformity, wearing team jerseys/uniforms, referencing "the group," "us," or "we." They show a fear of being ostracized or standing out negatively. They follow the consensus.
* Linguistic Tags: "We," "Us," "The team," "Everyone."
* FrameLord Strategy: Emphasize common ground. "You are one of us." "The whole team is doing this."
* Risk: They will not make a decision without group consensus.19
6.3 Secondary Needs Classification
These often modify the Primary Need:
* Intelligence: Needs to be seen as the smartest in the room. They brag about degrees, books read, or "figuring things out." Strategy: Ask for their advice/opinion. "I need your brain on this".19
* Pity: Identifying as a victim. Constantly shares misfortunes, illnesses, or "bad luck" stories to gain sympathy. Strategy: Validate their suffering. "You've had it harder than anyone." Do not try to "fix" it; just witness it.19
* Strength/Power: The "Tough Guy" mask. Overt aggression, dominance displays, firm handshakes, invading space. Usually hides deep weakness/fear (Axiom 1). Strategy: Acknowledge their strength/resilience. "You're a survivor".19
________________
7. The Decision Map: Predictive Behavior Modeling
7.1 Decision-Making Styles
FrameLord predicts how a subject will make a choice (e.g., to confess, to buy, to comply) by identifying their decision-making style. People do not make decisions based on logic; they make decisions based on a specific psychological pathway, then use logic to justify it. FrameLord identifies six styles.3
1. Deviance: Motivated by breaking rules, going against the grain, or being different.
   * Hook: "This is not for everyone," "The bosses don't want you to know this," "This is a bit controversial."
2. Novelty: Motivated by newness, innovation, and being "first."
   * Hook: "This is the latest method," "Brand new technology," "You'll be the first to have it."
3. Social: Motivated by the impact on relationships and people.
   * Hook: "Your team will love this," "This will help your family," "Imagine the look on their faces."
4. Conformity: Motivated by doing what everyone else is doing (Social Proof).
   * Hook: "Most people choose option B," "This is the standard procedure," "It's the bestseller."
5. Investment: Motivated by ROI, saving time, or fear of wasted resources.
   * Hook: "This saves you time," "Best value," "It pays for itself."
6. Necessity: Motivated by urgency, crisis, and lack of choice.
   * Hook: "We need to act now," "This is critical," "We are out of time."
7.2 The Algorithm: Linguistic Tagging
FrameLord scans the subject's query history and statement patterns to assign a Decision_Style tag.
* Input: "Is this the newest version available?" -> Tag: Novelty.
* Input: "What do most of your clients do?" -> Tag: Conformity.
* Input: "Will this get me in trouble?" (Hopeful tone) -> Tag: Deviance.
* Output Strategy: The AI re-writes the operator's persuasion script to match the detected tag. If the subject is Conformity, FrameLord suppresses "Unique/New" arguments and amplifies "Popular/Standard" arguments.20

8. The Six-Minute X-Ray (6MX) Sequence
8.1 The Rapid Profiling Loop
The 6MX is FrameLord's runtime executable—a linear, time-bounded process to profile a stranger in under six minutes. It synthesizes all previous modules into a workflow.3
* Minute 1: Observation (The Scan)
   * Goal: Establish Baseline behavior and comfort levels.
   * Action: Scan BTE for initial stress levels (Hand-to-face, feet withdrawal) before any interaction occurs.
   * Data: Identify "Eye Home" (does the subject look up/left or up/right?) and Blink Rate. Determine if the environment is cold (Blue Text Protocol).
* Minute 2: The Handshake/Intro (Contact)
   * Goal: Test Authority and Social Dominance.
   * Action: Execute the "Eyebrow Flash." Monitor for return.
   * Data: Assess Handshake pressure and angle (Palm up = Submissive, Palm down = Dominant). Assess "Authority Factors" (Is the subject confident or fidgety?).
* Minute 3: Elicitation (The Hook)
   * Goal: Extract data and test compliance.
   * Action: Deploy "The Hourglass Method" (See Section 9). Use "Complaint Baiting" (share a small complaint to see if they reciprocate—complaints reveal values).
   * Data: Does the subject mirror the operator's posture? (Rapport check).
* Minute 4: Needs Analysis
   * Goal: Identify the Psychological Basement.
   * Action: Listen for "I/Me/My" (Significance) vs. "We/Us" (Acceptance). Ask, "What's the best part of your job?" (Reveals what they value).
   * Data: Tag Primary Need: Significance, Approval, or Acceptance.
* Minute 5: Decision Mapping
   * Goal: Determine how to close the deal/influence.
   * Action: Propose a minor hypothetical choice or ask about a recent purchase/decision. "Why did you choose that phone?"
   * Data: Analyze answer for Decision Style (Novelty? Conformity? Investment?).
* Minute 6: The Synthesis
   * Goal: Generate the "User Manual."
   * Action: Combine Needs + Decision Style + Stress Baseline.
   * Output: Influence_Profile generated. The operator now knows what the subject needs, how they decide, and how to present the idea.3
________________
9. Influence and Intervention Vectors
9.1 The FATE Model (The Compliance Engine)
FrameLord uses the FATE model as the "operating system" for engineering compliance. To influence a subject, the system/operator must control four variables in a specific sequence. If one is missed, influence fails.7
1. F - Focus:
   * Concept: You cannot influence what you do not have the attention of.
   * Tactic: Use novelty, surprise, or a physical disruption to snap the subject out of "Autopilot." A sudden question, a physical touch, or a visual disruption manufactures focus.
2. A - Authority:
   * Concept: The subject must perceive the operator as higher status or "in charge" of the immediate context.
   * Tactic: Demonstrate the 5 Authority Factors (Section 5).
3. T - Tribe:
   * Concept: Humans trust "Us" more than "Them."
   * Tactic: Establish shared identity. Use mirroring (body language, vocal tempo). Use "We" language. Validate their worldview.
4. E - Emotion:
   * Concept: Decisions are emotional. Logic is secondary.
   * Tactic: Trigger an emotional state (fear, excitement, relief) before asking for the decision. The emotion provides the fuel; the logic steers the car.
9.2 Linguistics and Hypnotic Syntax
FrameLord utilizes "The Ellipsis Manual" tactics for covert influence, embedding commands into normal speech to bypass the critical factor of the conscious mind.23
* Double Binds:
   * Definition: Offering two choices that lead to the same outcome. It creates an illusion of choice.
   * Example: "Would you like to sign now, or after we review the summary?" (Implies signing is inevitable; the only choice is when).
   * AI Generation: FrameLord analyzes the goal (Sign Contract) and generates two positive paths.
* Embedded Commands:
   * Definition: Hiding directives within a sentence using analog marking (slight pause, tonal shift, or gesture).
   * Example: "When you feel comfortable, you can sign here."
   * Mechanism: The conscious mind hears the sentence; the subconscious hears the bolded commands.23
* Presuppositions:
   * Definition: Sentences that assume a fact to be true.
   * Example: "How happy will you be when this is done?" (Presumes: It will be done, and you will be happy).
   * Usage: FrameLord uses these to bypass resistance to the core premise.23
9.3 Elicitation: The Hourglass Method
To extract data without interrogation (which raises defenses), FrameLord scripts the "Hourglass Method":
1. Top of Hourglass (Broad): Start with a broad, safe topic (e.g., "Conferences are always so tiring").
2. Narrowing (Specific/Provocative): Make a specific, often incorrect, statement to provoke correction. This relies on the "Corrective Reflex"—people have a burning need to correct others.
   * Tactic: "I bet the keynote speaker was boring."
   * Result: Subject corrects: "Actually, he was great, he talked about."
3. Bottom of Hourglass (Broad): Return to broad topics immediately to "bury" the elicited nugget so the subject doesn't realize they leaked info.3

10. Risk Assessment and Threat Modeling
10.1 Pre-Violence Indicators (PVI) and Redshift
FrameLord monitors for "Redshift"—the physiological and behavioral ramp-up to physical violence. These cues appear 5-10 seconds before an attack.22
* The "Target Glance": The subject's gaze shifts from the operator's eyes to the chin, nose, or throat (striking zones). This is the "targeting computer" locking on.
* The "Checking" Scan: A rapid scan of the environment (left/right/behind) to look for witnesses, police, or escape routes. (BTE Element: Sc - Scanning).
* Grooming Gestures: Adjusting clothing (tightening cuffs, removing glasses, pulling up pants). This is subconsciously "clearing the decks" for action.
* Blading: Turning the body side-on to reduce the target profile and protect vitals.
* Pulsing: Visible vein throbbing in the neck (Carotid) or temples due to massive blood pressure spike (Adrenaline dump).
* The "Push" Breath: Short, sharp exhalations (like a boxer).
10.2 The Threat Score Algorithm
If PVI_Count > 3 within 10 seconds, FrameLord triggers THREAT_LEVEL_CRITICAL.
* Action: The system advises the operator to break eye contact, step back (increase distance), and show palms (submissive gesture) to de-escalate the "Redshift".22

11. FrameLord Operational Logic (Final Synthesis)
11.1 The "User Manual" Output Vector
Upon completing the analysis cycle (Scan -> Profile -> Elicit), FrameLord generates a comprehensive "User Manual" for the target subject. This output vector synthesizes all behavioral data into actionable intelligence for the operator.
Sample Output Structure:
SUBJECT ID: 9384-Alpha
PRIMARY NEED: Significance (Feed ego, validate status).
DECISION STYLE: Novelty (Pitch new/unique solutions).
AUTHORITY RATING: Low (High insecurity detected: Fidgeting, Lip Compression).
DECEPTION INDEX: High (Cluster detected: Shrug + Throat Clasp + Pronoun Drop on topic "Financials").
SUGGESTED APPROACH: "Mirror high energy. Compliment specific achievements to satisfy. Frame the request as a 'revolutionary new opportunity' to trigger [Novelty]. Do not challenge the mask directly. Use 'Embedded Commands' for agreement."
11.2 The Feedback Loop and Calibration
FrameLord continuously updates the profile in real-time.
* Input: Operator executes suggested strategy.
* Observation: Subject displays Comfort signals (BTE Left Side: Head Tilt, Open Palms).
* Result: Confidence_Score of the profile increases.
* Observation: Subject displays Stress signals (BTE Right Side: Lip Compression, Elbow Closure).
* Result: System flags "Profile Mismatch" or "Topic Sensitivity." FrameLord recalibrates the Needs Map and suggests a "Back-off" strategy (switch to Rapport building).18
